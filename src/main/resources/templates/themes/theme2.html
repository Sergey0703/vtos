                1)	In the video we can see young man that helps lady to pull her carriage on the street, gives gay to the tired woman in transport, feeds a hungry dog in the cafe, treats the old lady(may be neighbor) bananas, replace a pot with the flower under water, gives money small girls that very needs the money.
                2)	The message/moral of the story: if you carry good deeds for other people and do that selflessly, to these good deeds will come back to you with such feelings that not money cannot buy.
                3)
                a) In my opinion it is not needs more words to convey the messages in this story. Every scene in this story is very impressive- poor(not rich) furniture , lack of lightning in the houses very contrast with bright images of people.
                b)  Every person in this story expresses emotions very clearly for all audiences, each of us can understand expression of perplexity or happiness our person in this story.
                c)We see expressions of perplexity on the face of old man when our hero gives money poor girl,  the dissatisfaction of the cook is clearly visible when the hero feeds the dog in a cafe -we clearly can easy interpret these messages.
